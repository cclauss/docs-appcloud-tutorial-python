<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step youâ€™ll learn how to propagate a local change to the application through to <%= vars.product_short %>. As a simple change, we'll modify the title which the app shows.

Change the `return` property in the `app.py` file to 'I am awesome!'. Your final result should look something like this:

```python
"""CF Sample App Python"""

from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

port = int(os.getenv("PORT", "3000"))

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'I am awesome!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)

```

Now test locally:

<pre class="terminal">
$ python app.py
</pre>

Visiting your application at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>, you should see the changed title. **You are awesome!**

Now deploy. All you need to do is `cf push` again:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-python-app
</pre>

Finally, check that everything is working by visiting your app's URL from your web browser.

<div style="text-align:center;margin:3em;">
  <a href="./environment.html" class="btn btn-primary">I can push local changes</a>
</div>
